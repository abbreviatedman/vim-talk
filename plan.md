# Vim Talk - Plan

## What This Talk Is About

- Vim as an editing language that can run everywhere--including in VS Code!
- What makes it so goshdarned _fast_.
- Convincing you to give the Vim editing language a real shot.

## What This Talk Isn't About

- Vim as a terminal app--though it's really great!
- Telling you that Vim is right for you.

## So Why Use The Vim Editing Language?

### It Makes you a faster solution implementer.

- Developers' time:
  - 90% researching and thinking about what change needs to happen
  - 10% making that change
- Vim does nothing for your research and your thinking and your problem-solving skills.
- But it makes that time where you're making the change almost instantaneous--no friction between the change you want to make and it happening.
- A skilled Vim user effectively wishes a change to happen and it just... happens.

### It's Everywhere

Once you know Vim, you can always use it.

- the terminal app is on almost all Linux, Unix, and Mac machines.
- you can use its editing language in VS Code and almost all other editors
- and in many online IDEs as well--REPL, Codewars, LeetCode, HackerRank, and more

## How Is It So Fast?

### Vim uses a **modal** editing system for its keybindings.

So we don't have to use Command-Shift-K to delete a line, just `dd`. We achieve this by having:

- a mode where typing things actually enters those letters onto the screen
- a mode where every letter and symbol on your keyboard is instead a one-key editing shortcut

### A demo

## Install The Vim Extension

- Don't worry that this makes any kind of permanent change
  - It's easily toggleable on and off
  - Or disabled.
  - Or uninstalled.
  - In fact, you should probably turn it off after this talk!
- Let's install it!

## We'll Be Touring, Not Learning

I'm going to take you on a grand tour of the power of vim editing.

Do NOT try to memorize this lesson!

If/when you want to learn Vim, you should start with a SMALL subset of these commands
Then, when you have those down, add a couple more to your list.

You can get good with vim pretty quickly, but you'll have to be patient until you're great with vim.

Again, don't panic if you miss a few commands here. I'm just trying to give you a feel for what editing with vim is like!

## Order Of Commands

### Movement

- `hjkl`
  - convenient but too small, tendency to spam
  - `j`/`k` good with count--turn relative numbers on - VSCodeVim setting: "Smart Relative Line"
- `w`
- `b`
- `f`/`t` with `;`/`,`
- `/` with `n`/`N`
- `$`/`^`

### Use movement with x/r

#### Exercise 1: Remove and replace characters.

Don't forget `u` to undo!

### Use movement with d

Now we're combining a VERB, `d`, with a NOUN, saying what to do that verb TO.

So these can be read as

- `dj`: delete one line down (and the current line)
- `d3j`: delete 3 lines down (and the current line)
- `dtr`: delete to the `r`
- `d5w`: delete 5 words (technically, delete until you're at 5 `w` movements)
- `d/const` (and then hit return): delete until you hit the search term `const`.
- `d$`: delete until the end of the line
- `d^`: delete until the start of the line
- `dd`: delete the line - repeating a command almost always means "do this for the line"

#### Exercise 2: remove words and lines

Don't forget `u` to undo!

### Repetition

`.`

#### Exercise 4: repeating yourself

- delete until the end of the line a few times... `=== false`?
- delete a couple lines up a few times to get rid of sets of console logs
- find and replace `!` with `=`

### Normal mode vs. insert mode

We've been staying in what's called "normal mode", because for a coder the DEFAULT is to be editing text, not adding it.

But you'll definitely need to add text fairly often too.

And you'll be _changing_ text a lot too.

### Entering insert mode

- `i`/`a`
- `I`/`A`
- `o`/`O`

#### Exercise 5: repeating additions

- adding semi-colons at the end of lines
- adding `let` at the beginning of lines
- adding `$` just before `{` to make interpolating values work
- add `return arr` in accumulator pattern functions
