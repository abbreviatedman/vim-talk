# Vim Talk - Plan

## What This Talk Is About

- Vim as an editing language that can run everywhere--including in VS Code!
- What makes it so goshdarned _fast_.
- Convincing you to give the Vim editing language a real shot.

## What This Talk Isn't About

- Vim as a terminal app--though it's really great!
- Telling you that Vim is right for you.

## So Why Use The Vim Editing Language?

### It Makes you a faster solution implementer.

- Developers' time:
  - 90% researching and thinking about what change needs to happen
  - 10% making that change
- Vim makes that last 10% very, very fast.

### It's Everywhere

Once you know Vim, you can always use it.

- the terminal app is on almost all Linux, Unix, and Mac machines.
- you can use its editing language in VS Code and almost all other editors
- and in many online IDEs (including REPL, Codewars, LeetCode, and HackerRank)

## So It Won't Make You A Better Problem Solver

But it will make you a much better solution IMPLEMENTER.

## How Is It So Fast?

Vim uses a **modal** editing system for its keybindings.

## Install The Vim Extension

- Don't worry that this makes any kind of permanent change
  - It's easily toggleable on and off
  - Or disabled.
  - Or uninstalled.
  - In fact, you should probably turn it off after this talk!
- Let's install it!

## Order Of Commands

### Movement

- w
- b
- hjkl
  - convenient but too small, tendency to spam
  - j/k good with count, relative numbers on

## Later:

- Vim setting: "Smart Relative Line"
